# How to write new blog on Jekyll

Hi,

I was asked how to write a new blog into our Jekyll. It's [really straight forward](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). Here's list of steps you need to do:

1. Clone this repository: ```git clone git@github.com:RedHatNordicsSA/RedHatNordicsSA.github.io.git```
2. Make sure you have Jekyll installed, [instructions for RHEL](https://redhatnordicssa.github.io/install-jekyll-on-rhel)
3. If on RHEL, enter software channel: ```scl enable rh-ruby23 bash```
4. Edit your blog in \_posts directory, create new file with name:
   YYYY-MM-DD-topic.markdown.
   e.g. ```atom _posts/2019-02-18-new-post.markdown```
5. Add header to post, like in this topic:
   ```

   tags: jekyll
   author: ikke

   ```
6. Start writing using
   [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
   If you want to attach e.g pictures, add them to assets/images -directory.
   We use Hacker theme for now, see
   [their example here](https://pages-themes.github.io/hacker/).
7. Once done, make sure the date and time in header is passed, or drop the post
   into \_drafts folder. Jekyll uses the time to publish blog only after given
   time.
8. Try locally by starting local Jekyll server in repository directory
   (bundle install is here just in case you skipped something):
  ```
  bundle install
  jekyll serve
  ```
  Now you can browse to http://localhost:4000 to review your blog. If you
  dropped the blog into \_drafts/, add ```--drafts``` to command.
9. Once happy, do ```git status``` to verify no junk is added, and do
   ```git add``` for added files, and ```git commit``` and ```git push```
10. After few seconds, your blog should be visible
    [at site blog list](https://redhatnordicssa.github.io/blogs/).

For reference, see [this blog markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatNordicsSA/RedHatNordicsSA.github.io/master/_posts/2019-02-18-new-post.markdown).
