# Welcome to Nordics SA blog!

We are Red Hat Solution Architects from Northern Europe, Nordics as they call our countries, and Nerdics as we call ourselves :D

Purpose of this page is to *open our demos to you*, dear reader. We hold quite much demos as part of our work, and see that they might be useful starting point for our customers too. So in the spirit of open source, naturally we want to get you quickly into speed by sharing our demo automation code here in Git.

We have some of demo environments in use, and we start here by describing our demo environment in Cisco lab. They kindly donated us some sandbox. Feel free to start getting ideas by reading description of that lab in [Lab description blog (TBD)](./blogs/index.html).

## Automation samples available as code

We aim to collect all automation code as Ansible playbooks and roles into our git repository, [https://github.com/redhatnordicssa].

There will Ansible playbooks (to mention some)

* Red Hat Virtualization guest setup
* Red Hat Satellite client setup
* IPAM server and client setup
* Nagios monitoring and client setup
* Usable via Ansible command line or Tower
* CloudForms Automation
* GlusterFS setup


Happy reading, I hope you enjoy and benefit of [our blogs](./blogs/index.html)!
